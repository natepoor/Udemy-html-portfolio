<hr>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</h3>
<p>This is my favorite film. It is highly critacly aclaimed for a reason. Plus it's a perfect  ending to a perfect trilogy</p>
<h3>Star Wars the Empire Strikes Back</h3>
<p>My second favorite film to my favorite franchise. In my opinion it has very good writing. The good guys don't always win</p>
<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen 0</h3>
<p>My favorite anime film. It always gets me emotional. Even though it is a prequal to a series, it is a great standalone film</p>
